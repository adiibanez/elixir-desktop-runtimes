# Elixir-Desktop Runtimes

To use elixir-desktop on mobile-phones this projects packages the BEAM Virtual Machine into platform specific binaries. Currently supported are:

- Android arm 64-bit
- Android arm 32-bit
- Android x86 64-bit (for the Android Simulator)
- iOS arm 64-bit (current iPhones)
- iOS arm 64-bit (MacOS M1 Simulator)

## Building Android Runtimes

Android runtimes depends on docker and the dockercross/* docker-images created for cross-compilation. If docker is installed for your current user then building all the runtimes bundled in a zip file is as easy as:

`mix package.android.runtime`

After this you should have all runtimes in `_build/#{arch}-runtime.zip` these then will need to be packaged with your mobile app. 

## Building iOS Runtimes

For iOS builds are triggered similiary with:

`mix package.ios.runtime`

After the build succeeds there will be a xcframework directory in _build/liberlang.xcframework. Copy this into your Xcode project and add it to your target.
